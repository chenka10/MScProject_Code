This repository contains all the models and experimental code for my MSc Thesis "Blob Representation of Robotic Surgical Scenes for Position-Aware Video Generation".
On this research project I generated Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) videos conditioned on the kinematic information of the surgical tools.

I researched the effect of applying physical constraints to the generated tools by representing them as "Blobs".

Qualitive Results (singular generated test frames):
